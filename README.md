# Healthcare Database Project

## Introduction

This project consists of adatabase management system specifically designed for a healthcare app. It utilizes PostgreSQL and Docker for data storage and management, incorporating advanced features such as materialized views and integrity constraints to ensure data accuracy and efficiency.
Furthermore, we also implemented a RESTful API to interact with the database via web requests. You can test the SAUDE Management System API endpoints using Bruno.
